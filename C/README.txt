Here you can find classical struct implementations in C.
-list : classic implentation of a list
-list memory : push_front and push_back method don't change memory adress.
(Make sur you understand the difference beetween struct list and struct list memory)

about sort method, implementation is O(nlog(n)) and create another list in both files.
